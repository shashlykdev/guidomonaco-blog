- Authentic restaurants for every meal
- Strategic timing to avoid crowds

---

## Before You Start: Essential Info

### Museum Reservations (Book NOW)

**Uffizi Gallery** and **Accademia** require advance tickets. Book 1-2 weeks ahead or you'll waste hours in line.

- **Uffizi:** Book at [uffizi.it](https://www.uffizi.it/en/tickets) or [official ticketing site](https://www.b-ticket.com/b-ticket/uffizi/)
- **Accademia:** Book at [official site](https://www.galleriaaccademiafirenze.it/en/)
- **Reservation fee:** €4 per ticket (worth every cent)
- **Best time slots:** 9:00-10:00 AM (beat the crowds)

### What to Bring Each Day

- **Comfortable walking shoes** (you'll do 15,000+ steps daily)
- **Water bottle** (refill at public fountains)
- **Small daypack** (for layers, as temperatures change)
- **Power bank** (for photos and maps)
- **Cash** (small restaurants/markets prefer it)

### Timing Philosophy

This itinerary follows the **early bird strategy**: start early, hit major sights first, break for long lunches when crowds peak, explore neighborhoods in late afternoon, eat late dinners like Italians do.

**You'll avoid crowds and see Florence at its best.**

---

## Day 1: Historic Center & Renaissance Art

**Theme:** First impressions—major landmarks, Uffizi, and Florentine food  
**Walking distance:** 6-7 km  
**Budget:** €60-80 per person

### Morning (8:00-13:00)

#### 8:00 - Breakfast Near Your Apartment

Start at **Caffè Gilli** or any local café within 5 minutes of Via Guido Monaco.

**Order:**
- Cappuccino + cornetto (€3-4)
- Stand at the bar like locals (sitting costs more)

**Insider tip:** Never order cappuccino after 11:00 AM in Italy. It's a breakfast drink. Switch to espresso.

#### 8:45 - Walk to Duomo (12 minutes)

**Route:** Via Guido Monaco → Via de' Cerretani → Piazza del Duomo

**First sight:** The Duomo (Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore) will stop you in your tracks. The green, pink, and white marble façade is one of the most photographed buildings in the world.

**What to do:**
- **Exterior photos** (free, 20 minutes) - Walk around the cathedral, Baptistery, and Giotto's Bell Tower
- **Enter the Cathedral** (free, 30 minutes) - The interior is surprisingly plain compared to the exterior, but the dome frescoes are incredible
- **Climb the Dome** (€18, 463 steps, reserve ahead) - Best views in Florence, but save this for Day 3 if you're not an early riser

**Timing:** Arrive by 9:00 to avoid crowds. By 10:30, the piazza is packed.

#### 10:30 - Uffizi Gallery (Pre-booked)

**Walk:** 8 minutes from Duomo to Uffizi (Piazzale degli Uffizi)

**Time needed:** 2-3 hours minimum

**What to see:**
- **Botticelli's "Birth of Venus" and "Primavera"** (Rooms 10-14) - The most famous paintings
- **Leonardo da Vinci** (Room 35) - His Annunciation is here
- **Michelangelo's "Tondo Doni"** (Room 35) - His only panel painting
- **Caravaggio** (Room 90) - Dramatic lighting genius
- **Terrace café** - Take a break halfway through, cappuccino with Palazzo Vecchio views

**Strategy:** Start at Room 2 (13th century), work chronologically through Renaissance art. Most tourists rush to Botticelli and skip everything else—you'll have earlier rooms to yourself.

**Insider tip:** The gift shop at the exit has better souvenirs than street vendors.

### Lunch (13:00-15:00)

#### Option 1: Trattoria Mario (Traditional Florentine)

**Walk:** 15 minutes from Uffizi (Via Rosina 2r, near San Lorenzo market)  
**Price:** €15-25 per person  
**Vibe:** Shared tables, paper menus, zero pretension

**Order:**
- Pappa al pomodoro (tomato bread soup)
- Bistecca alla Fiorentina (if you eat meat)
- House Chianti
- Panna cotta for dessert

**Expect to wait:** 20-30 minutes if you arrive at peak lunch (13:00-14:00). Worth it.

#### Option 2: Mercato Centrale (Quick & Casual)

**Walk:** 12 minutes from Uffizi  
**Price:** €10-15 per person  
**Vibe:** Food hall, 20+ vendors, communal seating

**Best stalls:**
- Fresh pasta with wild boar ragù
- Lampredotto (tripe sandwich) from Leandro's stand
- Pizza al taglio
- Gelato

**Advantage:** Faster, more variety, good for picky eaters.

### Afternoon (15:00-19:00)

#### 15:30 - San Lorenzo Market & Neighborhood

**Walk:** Adjacent to Mercato Centrale

**What to explore:**
- **Outdoor market** (leather goods, souvenirs) - Haggle expected, quality varies
- **Basilica di San Lorenzo** (€6) - Brunelleschi's first church, understated beauty
- **Medici Chapels** (€9) - Michelangelo sculptures, skip if you're museum-ed out

**Shopping tips:**
- Leather jackets: €80-200 (haggle 20-30% off asking price)
- Scarves, bags: Better prices here than near the Duomo
- Skip anything with "genuine leather" signs (usually not)

#### 17:00 - Walk to Ponte Vecchio (15 minutes)

**Route:** San Lorenzo → Via de' Tornabuoni (window shopping luxury brands) → Ponte Vecchio

**What to do:**
- **Walk across the bridge** - Medieval bridge lined with jewelry shops, iconic photo spot
- **Sunset from Ponte Santa Trinita** (5 min walk) - Better views of Ponte Vecchio than from the bridge itself
- **Cross to Oltrarno** - Quieter, artisan workshops, local vibe

#### 18:00 - Aperitivo in Oltrarno

**Piazza Santo Spirito** (10 minutes from Ponte Vecchio)

**Best spots:**
- **Volume** - Craft cocktails, hipster vibe, €8-12 drinks
- **Il Rifrullo** - More relaxed, outdoor seating, €6-9 drinks
- **Pop Caffè** - Local favorite, aperitivo buffet with drink

**How it works:** Order a drink (€6-10), get access to free snacks (olives, chips, small sandwiches). Not a full meal, but holds you over until dinner.

### Dinner (20:00-22:30)

#### Il Latini (Traditional Tuscan Feast)

**Walk:** 20 minutes back across the river (Via dei Palchetti 6r)  
**Reservation:** Helpful but walk-ins accepted  
**Price:** €35-45 per person

**Why tonight:** You've walked 15,000+ steps, you're tired, you're hungry. Il Latini will feed you family-style Tuscan dishes until you beg them to stop. Prosciutto hanging from ceilings, bottomless wine, communal tables. This is the Florence you imagined.

**What to expect:**
- Antipasti keep arriving (prosciutto, salami, pecorino)
- Pasta (pici cacio e pepe, pappardelle with wild boar)
- Meat (bistecca if you're sharing, roasted meats)
- Cantucci + Vin Santo for dessert
- Too much wine

**Insider tip:** Tell them it's your first night in Florence. They'll treat you like family.

### Evening Walk (22:30-23:00)

Walk back to your apartment via **Piazza della Signoria** (lit up at night, fewer tourists, romantic).

**Distance:** 15 minutes  
**Nightcap:** Gelato from **Vivoli** or **La Carraia** if you pass them

---

## Day 2: Michelangelo's David, Leather, & Hidden Florence

**Theme:** Art, shopping, neighborhoods  
**Walking distance:** 5-6 km  
**Budget:** €50-70 per person

### Morning (8:30-13:00)

#### 8:30 - Breakfast

Same café or try **Ditta Artigianale** (specialty coffee, 8 min from Via Guido Monaco, €4-6).

#### 9:00 - Accademia Gallery (Pre-booked)

**Walk:** 15 minutes from Via Guido Monaco (Via Ricasoli)

**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours

**What to see:**
- **Michelangelo's David** - The reason you're here. 5 meters tall, carved from a single block of marble, perfection. Spend 20 minutes just looking at it from all angles.
- **Unfinished Slaves** - Michelangelo's sculptures emerging from raw marble, fascinating process
- **Musical instrument collection** - Stradivarius violins, skip if you're not into it

**Strategy:** Go straight to David (end of the main corridor), spend time there, then backtrack through the rest of the gallery.

**Insider tip:** The replica David in Piazza della Signoria gets better photos (no crowds, natural light). See the real one here for the art, photograph the replica later.

#### 10:30 - Explore the Neighborhood

**Via de' Servi** (the street leading from Accademia toward Duomo)

**What to see:**
- **Basilica della Santissima Annunziata** (free) - Often empty, beautiful frescoed cloister
- **Piazza della Santissima Annunziata** - Elegant Renaissance square, locals sitting on steps
- **Ospedale degli Innocenti** (€7, optional) - Europe's first orphanage, Brunelleschi architecture

**Why this matters:** You'll have this area almost to yourself while everyone else queues at the Duomo.

#### 11:30 - Walk Back Through Duomo Area

**Photo ops:**
- Baptistery bronze doors (Ghiberti's "Gates of Paradise")
- Duomo from Via dell'Oriuolo (side view, fewer people)
- Giotto's Bell Tower (climb it if you skipped the Dome yesterday - €18, 414 steps)

### Lunch (13:00-15:00)

#### Mercato Centrale (Upstairs Food Hall)

**Walk:** 10 minutes from Duomo  
**Price:** €10-18 per person  
**Why:** Yesterday was a long sit-down lunch. Today, fast and flexible.

**Order:**
- Lampredotto sandwich (if you didn't try it yesterday)
- Fresh pasta (cacio e pepe, amatriciana)
- Wine by the glass
- Gelato for dessert

**Advantage:** You're back in the San Lorenzo area for afternoon shopping.

### Afternoon (15:00-19:00)

#### 15:00 - Leather Shopping (If Interested)

**San Lorenzo Market** (outdoor stalls) vs **Leather School at Santa Croce** (higher quality, fixed prices)

**Budget:**
- Market leather jackets: €80-150
- Leather School: €200-400 (better quality, no haggling)

**Skip if:** Not interested in leather. Move to next activity.

#### 16:00 - Santa Croce & Oltrarno

**Option A: Santa Croce Basilica** (€8, 30 min walk from San Lorenzo)
- Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelli tombs
- Giotto frescoes
- Beautiful cloisters

**Option B: Oltrarno Artisan Neighborhood** (more interesting)

**Walk:** 25 minutes from San Lorenzo, or 15 from Santa Croce

**What to explore:**
- **Via Santo Spirito** - Antique shops, artisan workshops, locals drinking espresso
- **Palazzo Pitti** (exterior only, save interior for another trip) - Massive Renaissance palace
- **Boboli Gardens** (€10, skip unless you love gardens) - Big, green, lots of stairs

**Best activity:** Just wander. Oltrarno is where Florentines live. Small piazzas, neighborhood trattorias, less polished than the tourist center.

#### 18:00 - Aperitivo Part 2

**Piazza Santo Spirito** (same area as yesterday, different bar)

Or try **Il Santino** (Via Santo Spirito 60r) - Natural wine bar, excellent small plates, €20-30 per person for wine + food.

### Dinner (20:30-22:30)

#### Trattoria Sostanza (Il Troia)

**Reservation:** Essential (book 2-3 days ahead)  
**Walk:** 10 minutes from Oltrarno  
**Price:** €35-50 per person

**The move:** Butter chicken (yes, in Italy). Sostanza has been making it for 100+ years. It's legendary. Or bistecca alla Fiorentina if you want traditional.

**Vibe:** Shared tables, white tablecloths, old-guard Florence. They won't smile unless you earn it, but the food is spectacular.

#### Alternative: Buca Lapi (If Sostanza is Booked)

**Walk:** 12 minutes from Via Guido Monaco  
**Price:** €50-70 per person  
**Vibe:** Wine cellar setting, more upscale, excellent bistecca

### Evening (22:30-23:30)

**Walk:** Via de' Tornabuoni (luxury shopping street, lit up, window shop) → Piazza della Repubblica (carousel, street musicians) → back to your apartment

**Gelato stop:** Grom or Perché No! if you pass them

---

## Day 3: Views, Markets, & Your Choice

**Theme:** Morning views, market lunch, afternoon flex  
**Walking distance:** 5-8 km (depending on choices)  
**Budget:** €40-80 per person

### Morning (8:00-13:00)

#### 8:00 - Early Start for Piazzale Michelangelo

**Why early:** Sunrise views, fewer tourists, cooler temperatures for the climb

**How to get there:**
- **Walk (30-40 min, mostly uphill)** - Free, good exercise, beautiful neighborhoods
- **Bus 12 or 13** (€1.50, 15 min) - From Santa Maria Novella area

**Walk route if you're up for it:**
Via Guido Monaco → Ponte alle Grazie → Lungarno Serristori → stairs up to Piazzale Michelangelo

**What you'll see:**
- **Panoramic Florence view** - The entire city, Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, hills beyond
- **Replica David statue** (better photo op than inside Accademia)
- **San Miniato al Monte** (5 min walk uphill from Piazzale) - 11th-century church, often empty, peaceful

**Time needed:** 1-1.5 hours

**Insider tip:** Come back here at sunset (18:30-19:30) if you have energy. It's even better at golden hour.

#### 10:00 - Walk Back Down or Take Bus

**Stop at:** Ponte Vecchio (if coming from Piazzale Michelangelo) for morning photos with better light than Day 1

#### 10:30 - Climb Something Tall

**Choose one:**

**Option A: Duomo Cupola Climb** (€18, 463 steps, reserve ahead)
- Best views in Florence
- Claustrophobic stairs
- Worth it if you like heights

**Option B: Giotto's Bell Tower** (€18, 414 steps, no reservation)
- Same views, easier climb
- Better photo of the Duomo itself (since you're not on it)

**Option C: Palazzo Vecchio Tower** (€12.50 with museum, 223 steps)
- Fewer tourists
- Good views, less iconic than Duomo/Bell Tower

**Skip:** If you're tired from Piazzale Michelangelo climb. Rest instead.

### Lunch (12:30-14:30)

#### Mercato di Sant'Ambrogio (Local Market)

**Walk:** 20 minutes from Duomo area (Piazza Ghiberti)  
**Why:** This is where Florentines shop. Few tourists. Real market.

**What to do:**
- **Walk through the produce stalls** (outside) - Seasonal fruits, vegetables, vendors yelling prices
- **Eat at Trattoria da Rocco** (inside market) - €10-15, daily specials, communal tables, zero English, all flavor
- **Alternative: Trattoria del Mercato Vecchio** (near the market) - Slightly more polished but still local

**Order:**
- Whatever the daily special is
- House wine
- Ask for "il piatto del giorno" (plate of the day)

**Vibe:** You might be the only tourists. Embrace it.

### Afternoon (15:00-19:00): Choose Your Own Adventure

You've seen the major sights. Pick what interests you:

#### Option 1: More Museums

**Palazzo Vecchio** (€12.50, 2 hours)

- Lavishly decorated rooms
- Tower climb for views
- Hall of the Five Hundred (massive)

**Bargello Museum** (€8, 1 hour)

- Quiet paths

**Or just sit:** Piazza Santo Spirito with a book and gelato.

#### Option 3: Final Shopping

**Via de' Tornabuoni** - Window shop luxury (Gucci, Ferragamo)  
**Mercato Nuovo** - Tourist souvenirs (rub the bronze boar's nose for luck)  
**Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica** - 400-year-old pharmacy, beautiful interior, buy rose water or potpourri (€8-15)

#### Option 4: Day Trip (If You're Ambitious)

**Fiesole** (30 min bus #7 from Santa Maria Novella station, €1.50)
- Hilltop town above Florence

- Views
- Peaceful escape

**Siena** (1.5 hours by train/bus, €10-15)
- Medieval town, Palio horse race (twice yearly)
- Duomo, Piazza del Campo
- Full day trip, not afternoon

**Skip day trips:** If you're tired. Florence has enough.

### Aperitivo (18:00-20:00)

**Last aperitivo:** Pick your favorite spot from the last 2 days, or try somewhere new:

**Caffè Giacosa (Cavalli)** - Historic bar, birthplace of the Negroni, €10-12 drinks  
**Procacci** - Truffle sandwiches + prosecco, standing only, €8-15

### Dinner (20:30-23:00): Final Night Options

**Price:** €70-100 per person  
**Walk:** 20 minutes from Via Guido Monaco (or 10 min bus)

**Why:** Celebrate your last night with modern Italian creativity. Tasting menu, wine pairing, proper fine dining.

#### Option 2: Traditional - Buca Lapi

**Price:** €50-70 per person  
**Walk:** 12 minutes

**Why:** Wine cellar setting, perfect bistecca, classic Tuscan. Good middle ground between casual and fancy.

#### Option 3: Casual - Gustapizza

**Price:** €10-15 per person  
**Walk:** 25 minutes to Oltrarno

**Why:** Best Neapolitan pizza in Florence. Standing on the street eating €8 pizza. Unpretentious end to your trip.

#### Option 4: Back Where You Started

**Il Latini** (if you loved it Day 1)  
**Trattoria Mario** (if you want lunch-style dinner)

### Evening Walk (23:00)

**Final Florence moment:** Walk along the Arno river. Ponte Vecchio lit up. Quiet streets. Reflect on 3 days well spent.

**Gelato:** One last scoop. Vivoli. La Carraia. Grom. Whoever's open.

## Practical Tips for Your 3 Days

### Best Times to Avoid Crowds

**Early morning (8:00-10:00):**

- Piazzale Michelangelo
- Any outdoor attraction

**Midday (13:00-15:00):**
- Neighborhood wandering while tourists are at museums

### Where to Refill Water

**Free public fountains:**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is 3 days enough for Florence?

Yes. Three days is ideal for first-time visitors. You'll see all major sights, eat well, and not feel rushed. Less than 3 days = you'll miss key museums. More than 3 days = you'll either revisit favorites, take day trips (Siena, Pisa, Cinque Terre), or spend more time in neighborhoods. But for "see Florence," 3 days is the sweet spot.

### Do I need to book Uffizi and Accademia tickets in advance?

YES. Non-negotiable. Walk-up lines are 2-4 hours in high season (April-October). Even in winter, advance tickets save time. Book 1-2 weeks ahead. Reservation fee is €4 per ticket. Worth it.

### Can I really walk to everything from the train station area?

Yes. Florence historic center is compact. From Via Guido Monaco (5 min from station): Duomo 12 min, Uffizi 18 min, Accademia 15 min, Ponte Vecchio 20 min. You'll walk 15,000-20,000 steps daily, but that's normal for sightseeing. Comfortable shoes mandatory.

### What if I want to climb the Duomo dome?

Reserve ahead (same system as Uffizi/Accademia). Ticket is €18, includes Baptistery + Giotto's Bell Tower + Duomo Museum. The climb is 463 steps, tight spiral staircase, claustrophobic but incredible views. Do it first thing in the morning (8:30-9:00 slot) to avoid heat and crowds.

### Should I climb the Duomo or Giotto's Bell Tower?

**Duomo Dome (Cupola):** More iconic, tighter stairs, views FROM the dome  
**Giotto's Bell Tower:** Easier climb, separate structure, views OF the dome (better photos)  
**Both cost €18.** Pick based on claustrophobia tolerance and photo preference. Or do both if you love climbing.

### How much should I budget per day?

**Backpacker:** €40-60/day (cheap lunch, gelato dinner, skip expensive museums)  
**Mid-range:** €80-120/day (this itinerary, sit-down meals, major museums)  
**Comfort:** €150-200/day (Michelin dinners, extra museums, wine with every meal)  
**Does not include accommodation.**

### What's the best time of year for this itinerary?

**Best:** April-May (spring weather, flowers, not too hot), September-October (harvest season, cooler temps)  
**Good:** March, November (fewer tourists, cooler, some rain)  
**Avoid:** July-August (40°C heat, massive crowds, locals vacation)  
**Winter:** December-February is quiet and cold but doable

### Can I do this itinerary with kids?

Yes, but adjust. Fewer museums (max 1-1.5 hours each), more breaks (gelato, playgrounds), simpler meals (pizza, pasta, no long fancy dinners). Kids love: climbing towers, Ponte Vecchio, gelato, street performers, Leonardo da Vinci Museum.

### What if I'm vegetarian or have dietary restrictions?

Easy. Italian cuisine has tons of vegetarian options: pasta cacio e pepe, pappa al pomodoro, ribollita, margherita pizza, panzanella salad. Tell servers "sono vegetariano/a" and they'll guide you. Gluten-free ("senza glutine") is widely available. Michelin restaurants always accommodate dietary needs.

### Do I need to speak Italian?

No. Major museums, restaurants in this itinerary, and tourist areas have English speakers. But learning 5 phrases helps: buongiorno (hello), grazie (thank you), per favore (please), scusi (excuse me), il conto per favore (check please). Italians appreciate the effort.

### Can I visit Pisa or Siena on a day trip?

**Pisa:** 1-hour train, €8-15, easy half-day trip (see the tower, 2-3 hours total, back by lunch)  
**Siena:** 1.5-hour train/bus, €10-15, full-day trip (beautiful medieval town, Palio horse race twice yearly)  
**Both doable** from Florence. But if it's your first visit, spend all 3 days in Florence. Day trips = another trip.

### Where's the best gelato?

**Locals' picks:**
- **Vivoli** (Via Isola delle Stinche) - Old school, creamy, no cones
- **La Carraia** (multiple locations) - Affordable, always busy, locals love it
- **Gelateria dei Neri** (Via dei Neri) - Near Uffizi, excellent pistachio

**Tourist traps:** Bright-colored gelato piled high = fake. Real gelato is stored in covered metal tins.

### Should I take a cooking class?

If you love cooking, yes. Typical class: market visit, prep 3-4 dishes, eat what you make, 3-4 hours, €80-120/person. Book ahead. Skip if you'd rather spend that time eating at great restaurants (you're in Florence, let them cook for you).

### Is Florence safe?

Very. Pickpockets exist in tourist areas (Duomo, Uffizi lines), but violent crime is rare. Standard precautions: don't flash expensive items, watch your bag in crowds, don't leave phones on tables. You'll feel safer in Florence at night than most major cities.

### What if this itinerary is too much walking?

**Adjust:** Take buses (€1.50 per ride), taxis (expensive but convenient), or skip Piazzale Michelangelo climb. Focus on Duomo area + Uffizi + Accademia. Shorter days, longer lunches. Rest in the afternoon. Florence rewards slow travelers too.

## Final Thoughts: How to Experience Florence

This itinerary is a framework, not a rulebook. If you find a quiet piazza and want to sit for an hour watching life pass by—do that. If you fall in love with a trattoria and want to eat there twice—do that. If you're exhausted on Day 3 and want to skip museums for a long lunch and gelato crawl—do that.

**The secret to Florence:** It's not about checking off sights. It's about walking slowly through neighborhoods, eating food that makes you close your eyes and smile, and understanding why the Renaissance happened here.

Three days is enough to see Florence. But it's also just enough to make you want to come back.
