# Florence Wine Bars and Aperitivo: The First-Timer's Complete Guide

There's a moment that happens to almost every first-time visitor to Florence — usually around 6 PM, when the golden light softens across the Arno, the streets fill with the clink of glasses, and the entire city seems to collectively exhale after a day of art and architecture. That moment is *aperitivo* hour, and it is one of the most underrated pleasures of traveling in Tuscany.

Florence isn't just a city of David, Brunelleschi, and Botticelli. It's a city of Chianti, Negroni, and small plates of salumi that arrive, almost magically, alongside your drink. Whether you're a serious wine lover chasing rare Brunellos or simply someone who wants a cold glass of something delicious after a long day of sightseeing, Florence delivers.

This guide covers everything a first-timer needs to know about aperitivo culture in Florence, the best wine bars near Santa Maria Novella station, and how to drink like a Florentine — not a tourist.

## What Is Aperitivo? A Crash Course for First-Timers

If you're coming from Northern Europe or the US, the Italian concept of *aperitivo* might be new to you. Here's the short version:

**Aperitivo** is a pre-dinner drinking ritual that takes place between roughly 6 PM and 9 PM. You order a drink — typically something bitter, sparkling, or wine-based — and in many Florentine bars, a spread of small snacks (bruschetta, olives, chips, salumi) arrives automatically, included in the price of the drink.

It's not quite dinner, but it's more than a drink. It's a whole social ritual.

**Classic aperitivo drinks in Florence:**
- **Negroni** — Florence's own invention: gin + Campari + sweet vermouth. Iconic.
- **Aperol Spritz** — lighter, more refreshing, popular with tourists and locals alike
- **Campari Soda** — bitter, simple, perfect
- **Americano** — Campari + sweet vermouth + soda, the predecessor to the Negroni
- **Prosecco or local white wine** — clean and crisp if you want to skip the cocktails
- **Chianti** — at some wine bars, a glass of local red is the aperitivo of choice

The golden rule: don't rush it. Aperitivo is a leisurely ritual, not a shot before dinner. Order, settle in, and let Florence do its thing.

## The Negroni: Florence's Greatest Gift to the World

Before we get to specific wine bars, we need to talk about the Negroni — because Florence invented it, and you owe it to yourself to drink one here.

The story goes like this: in 1919, Count Camillo Negroni walked into Caffè Casoni (now Caffè Giacosa, on Via de' Tornabuoni) and asked the bartender, Fosco Scarselli, to strengthen his usual Americano by replacing the soda water with gin. Scarselli added an orange slice instead of the traditional lemon garnish, and a legend was born.

Drinking a Negroni in Florence isn't just a cocktail choice — it's a small act of historical participation. Order one on your first evening, sit outside if the weather allows, and raise a silent toast to Count Negroni.

**Where to have your first Negroni:**
- **Caffè Giacosa** (Via de' Tornabuoni, 83-R) — the birthplace. A pilgrimage spot.
- **Rasputin Cafe** (Via de' Benci, 9R) — beloved local bar with excellent Negronis
- **Mad Souls & Spirits** (Borgo San Frediano, 38R) — cocktail-forward, small, excellent

## Best Wine Bars Near Florence Train Station

Staying near Santa Maria Novella station puts you in an excellent position — some of Florence's most respected wine bars are within easy walking distance, and the entire city centre is on your doorstep.

### 1. Cantinetta Antinori — The Grand Dame of Florentine Wine

**Address:** Piazza Antinori, 3 (10 min walk from SMN)

The Antinori family has been making wine in Tuscany since 1385. Their Florence *cantinetta* (wine cellar/bar) is the definitive stop for serious Tuscan wine lovers. The wine list is deep — Tignanello, Solaia, Chianti Classico across multiple vintages — and the food menu is equally serious.

This isn't a cheap stop, but it's a once-in-a-trip experience. Go for a glass of their current-vintage Chianti Classico Riserva and a plate of cured meats. Sit at the bar if you want the full palazzo atmosphere.

**What to order:** Tignanello (splurge), or Pèppoli Chianti Classico for a more affordable glass of history.

**Best for:** Wine enthusiasts who want to taste something with real pedigree.

---

### 2. Enoteca Alessi — Florence's Most Beautiful Wine Shop

**Address:** Via delle Oche, 27-29R (15 min walk from SMN)

Enoteca Alessi has been a Florence institution since 1953. The shopfront is stunning — floor-to-ceiling bottles, old wooden shelves, a glass counter full of chocolates and Florentine sweets. It's part wine shop, part bar, part museum.

You can taste wines by the glass from a constantly rotating selection, and the staff will talk you through Tuscan appellations with patience and genuine enthusiasm. Grab a stool at the bar and ask for a recommendation.

**What to order:** Ask for their current pour of a Super Tuscan or a lesser-known Vermentino from the Maremma coast.

**Best for:** First-timers who want education alongside their wine.

---

### 3. Il Santino — The Wine Bar Sibling of Il Santo Bevitore

**Address:** Via di Santo Spirito, 60R (Oltrarno, 20 min walk from SMN)

Il Santino is a small, counter-style wine bar attached to the legendary Il Santo Bevitore restaurant. It's standing-room only, intimate, and serious about natural wines. The snack menu is exceptional — small plates of house-made charcuterie, aged cheeses, and creative bruschetta that pair perfectly with whatever they pour.

This is where Florentine food professionals drink. The wine list leans toward natural and biodynamic producers from across Italy, with a strong Tuscan backbone.

**What to order:** Ask what's open by the glass — they always have something interesting. Pair with the affettati misti (mixed cured meats).

**Best for:** Natural wine lovers and people who care deeply about what they eat alongside their drink.

---

### 4. Buca Mario — Historic Wine Bar in the City Centre

**Address:** Piazza Ottaviani, 16R (5 min walk from SMN)

One of Florence's oldest restaurants and wine bars, dating to 1886. Buca Mario sits in a historic vaulted cellar and serves an excellent range of Tuscan wines alongside traditional Florentine cuisine. It's not as trendy as some of the new-wave natural wine spots, but it's charming, unpretentious, and very good.

Ideal if you're staying near the station and don't want to travel far for a quality glass.

**What to order:** Vernaccia di San Gimignano (crisp Tuscan white) or a Morellino di Scansano.

**Best for:** History lovers and people who want tradition over trend.

---

### 5. Rasputin Cafe — The Local's Favourite Near SMN

**Address:** Via de' Benci, 9R (12 min walk from SMN)

Don't let the name fool you — Rasputin is one of Florence's most beloved neighbourhood bars, popular with locals, students, and savvy travellers who've found it by word of mouth. The cocktail list is excellent (the Negroni, in particular), the aperitivo spread is generous, and the vibe is relaxed and genuinely social.

This is the kind of place where you arrive for one drink and end up staying for three. Perfect for a first evening in Florence.

**What to order:** Negroni. Then another Negroni.

**Best for:** Solo travellers, couples looking for a lively atmosphere, anyone who wants to mix with locals.

---

### 6. Volume — The Bookshop Bar

**Address:** Via di Santo Spirito, 3R (18 min walk from SMN)

Volume is a bookshop by day and a wine bar/cocktail bar by evening. Bookshelves line the walls, the music is always interesting, and the crowd is young and creative. The aperitivo spread — which arrives when you order a drink after 6 PM — is generous: bruschetta, crostini, salumi, cheeses.

It's informal, buzzing, and genuinely fun. The wine list won't win awards, but you're here for the atmosphere as much as the drink.

**What to order:** House red or a spritz, then let the conversation take you where it goes.

**Best for:** People who want atmosphere over wine snobbery; great for solo travellers.

## Understanding Tuscan Wine: A 5-Minute Primer

Florence sits in the heart of Tuscany, one of the world's great wine regions. Here's the minimum you need to know to order confidently:

### The Reds
- **Chianti Classico** — Made from Sangiovese grapes, grown between Florence and Siena. The most famous Tuscan wine. Look for *Riserva* (minimum 2 years ageing) or *Gran Selezione* (minimum 2.5 years) for the best bottles.
- **Brunello di Montalcino** — Italy's most prestigious red wine. Rich, complex, long-lived. Expensive but worth it for a special occasion.
- **Vino Nobile di Montepulciano** — Similar grape to Chianti but from further south. Earthy, elegant, often underrated.
- **Super Tuscans** — Rule-breaking wines made with non-traditional grapes like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot. Tignanello and Sassicaia are the most famous.
- **Morellino di Scansano** — Sangiovese from the Maremma coast. Softer and more approachable than Chianti, excellent value.

### The Whites
- **Vernaccia di San Gimignano** — Tuscany's most famous white. Crisp, slightly nutty, mineral. Perfect aperitivo wine.
- **Vermentino** — Light, floral, slightly saline. From coastal Tuscany.
- **Pinot Grigio from Friuli** — Not Tuscan, but you'll find it everywhere. Clean and reliable.

### The Sparkling
- **Prosecco** — The default Italian sparkler, light and fruity.
- **Franciacorta** — Italy's answer to Champagne. Rich, complex, made by traditional method. Ask for it at serious wine bars.

**Quick ordering tip:** If you're unsure, say *"Un bicchiere di Chianti Classico, per favore"* (A glass of Chianti Classico, please). You'll never go wrong.

## Aperitivo Etiquette: How to Do It Like a Local

A few unwritten rules to know before you walk in:

1. **Don't arrive at 5 PM.** Aperitivo typically starts at 6 PM and peaks around 7-8 PM. Arriving early marks you as a tourist.

2. **The snacks are included.** At most proper aperitivo bars, the small bites arrive when you order a drink. You don't order them separately — they come. If a bar charges extra for the snacks, that's fine too (usually for a more elaborate spread).

3. **You're not expected to eat dinner.** Aperitivo is a ritual in itself. Some people do follow it with dinner; many Florentines don't. Don't feel obligated.

4. **Cash is still king** at small neighbourhood bars. Have some euros on you.

5. **Stand or perch.** Many wine bars in Florence are standing-room only, especially the small enoteche. Embrace it — it's more social.

6. **Speak the lingo.** A few words go a long way:
   - *"Un bicchiere di..."* — A glass of...
   - *"Cosa consiglia?"* — What do you recommend?
   - *"Salute!"* — Cheers!
   - *"Un altro, per favore"* — Another one, please (you'll need this)

## The Aperitivo Route: A Self-Guided Evening Walk

If you're staying near Santa Maria Novella station — as guests at **Guido Monaco apartment** are — here's a perfect evening aperitivo route:

**6:00 PM — Start at Piazza della Repubblica**
Begin at the city's grand 19th-century piazza. The café terraces here are touristy and overpriced, but the piazza itself is stunning at golden hour. Take a few photos, then move on quickly to better value spots.

**6:30 PM — First stop: Enoteca Alessi**
A 15-minute walk from the apartment. Have one glass of Vernaccia or a Chianti Classico at the bar. Talk to the staff. Let them recommend something.

**7:30 PM — Second stop: Caffè Giacosa**
This is where you drink your Negroni. Non-negotiable. Order, stand at the bar, sip slowly.

**8:30 PM — Optional third stop: Volume or Il Santino**
Cross the river to Oltrarno for the second act. Florence's left bank neighbourhood is more bohemian and local than the historic centre. Either of these spots will close out the evening perfectly.

**Return:** A pleasant 20-minute walk back to the apartment via Ponte Vecchio at night. Magnificent.

The **Guido Monaco apartment** — just 2 minutes from Santa Maria Novella station — is an ideal base for this kind of evening. Everything is walkable, and coming home after aperitivo (or continuing to dinner nearby) is entirely stress-free.

## FAQ: Florence Wine Bars and Aperitivo

### What is aperitivo in Florence and how does it work?
Aperitivo is a pre-dinner drinking tradition that takes place roughly between 6 PM and 9 PM. You order a drink at a bar — typically a cocktail, spritz, or glass of wine — and most Florentine bars will bring a plate of complimentary snacks (olives, bruschetta, chips, salumi). The tradition is social rather than strictly culinary: it's about slowing down, socializing, and easing into the evening. No reservation needed; just walk in and order.

### What wine should I order if I've never had Tuscan wine before?
Start with a **Chianti Classico** — it's the quintessential Tuscan red, made from Sangiovese grapes, and widely available at every wine bar in Florence. It's earthy, medium-bodied, and versatile with food. If you prefer white wine, ask for a **Vernaccia di San Gimignano** — crisp, slightly nutty, and the perfect aperitivo wine. Both are affordable (€5–10 per glass) and pair beautifully with the local food.

### Is the Negroni really from Florence?
Yes! The Negroni was invented in Florence in 1919, when Count Camillo Negroni asked bartender Fosco Scarselli to strengthen his Americano by replacing soda water with gin. Scarselli served it with an orange slice, and the cocktail spread across Italy and eventually the world. You can drink a Negroni at the original location — now Caffè Giacosa on Via de' Tornabuoni — making it one of the most historically grounded cocktail experiences in the world.

### What is the best area for wine bars in Florence?
The two best neighbourhoods are the **historic centre** (near Via de' Tornabuoni and the Piazza della Repubblica area) for grand, upscale enoteche, and **Oltrarno** (the left bank of the Arno, around Santo Spirito) for smaller, more bohemian natural wine bars. Guests staying near Santa Maria Novella station — like those at Guido Monaco apartment — are within easy walking distance of both areas.

### How much does aperitivo cost in Florence?
A cocktail or glass of wine typically costs €7–12 at a neighbourhood bar, €10–18 at a more upscale enoteca. The snacks that come with your drink are usually included in the price of the drink — no additional charge. For a full aperitivo evening (2 drinks each for 2 people), budget around €30–50. This is significantly less expensive than a full restaurant dinner and often just as satisfying.

## The Bottom Line

Florence's aperitivo culture is one of its greatest pleasures, and it's completely accessible to first-time visitors who know where to look. The combination of world-class Tuscan wine, handcrafted Negronis, and the city's extraordinary beauty at golden hour creates an evening ritual that you'll want to repeat every night of your stay.

The wine bars near Santa Maria Novella station are some of the city's best — Cantinetta Antinori, Enoteca Alessi, Buca Mario, and Rasputin Cafe are all within comfortable walking distance. And staying in the area means you're perfectly positioned to explore Oltrarno's natural wine scene and return home without needing a taxi.
